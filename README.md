# Outcome for IPU

A single page web app that provides results to IP University students in a tabular form and also displays the class ranks, university ranks, aggregate result summary of the student. One can also download their individual result in a PDF form and use it when offline. All it needs is the student's Roll Number and it fetches all the results available in the database.

### Updating Reappear Results  
The site currently doesn't support automatic updating of reappear results. However we can manually update them accordingly if you leave a comment on this [issue](https://github.com/Sid-2D/Outcome-IPU/issues/10).


### Note

* The parsers support parsing of any IPU Result of any course, so raise an issue if you want your course result to be displayed here.
* Works best on Chrome and Firefox.
